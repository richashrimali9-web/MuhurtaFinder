4. Consider adding Open Graph tags for better social media sharing
5. Add favicon with Astro Event Planner branding
6. Update any environment variables if needed

## Note on Component Names
The React component name `MuhurtaFinder` was kept as-is in the codebase (src/components/MuhurtaFinder.tsx and import statements) because:
- Renaming would require updating multiple import statements
- Component names are internal and don't affect user experience
- The displayed text/labels are what users see, and those are all updated
- Maintaining component names avoids potential breaking changes

If you want to rename the component files/exports as well, that can be done separately.
